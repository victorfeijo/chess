Chess 95 is web application that allows the user to simulate knight movements in N turns. The UI is inspired by windows 95 components which makes a nostalgic feeling when playing with it.

The application was bootstraped with AEboilerplate, a full-stack React/Redux/Node/Typescript web project starter that made development easier, clean and customizable. In addition, other important aspects like deployment and testing were ready to use out of the box.
