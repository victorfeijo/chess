# Chess 95 â™Ÿ

[![chess95 license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/victorfeijo/chess95/blob/master/LICENCE.md)

Chess 95 is web application that allows the user to simulate knight movements in N turns. The UI was inspired by windows 95 components which makes a nostalgic feeling when playing with it.

The application was bootstraped with [AEboilerplate](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/aeboilerplate), a full-stack React/Redux/Node/Typescript web project starter that made development easier, clean and customizable. In addition, other important aspects like deployment and testing were ready to use out of the box.

## Project Structure

Most of the architecture was inherited from [AEboilerplate](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/aeboilerplate/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) with a few additions. The application is divided in two independent applications. The **api**, which represents the back-end built on top of NodeJs, Express and PostgreSQL database, and the **client** - a front-end application generated using `create-react-app`.

Here's a list describing each technology used by each application:

- Client
  - Generated using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
  - [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for the HTTP client.
  - [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) using the [ducks modular approach](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for state management.
  - [React Router 4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy) for routing. \* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for testing.
  - [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) as a simple redux state selector library. Selectors can compute derived data (allowing store to be minimal as possible), efficient using function memoize and composable (a selector can use other selector as a input). Selectors tend to be easy to test because they are pure functions.
  - [React95](https://github.com/arturbier/React95) for UI components inspired by Windows 95 styles.
- API
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for routing.
  - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) database and [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) for query building. [Migrations](https://knexjs.org/#Migrations-CLI) and [seeds](https://knexjs.org/#Seeds-CLI) are included. \* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.
  - [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) javascript library designed for a functional programming style.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for running applications locally.
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), and [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) for consistent code formatting.
- [Github templates](https://blog.github.com/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/) for Github pull request templates.
